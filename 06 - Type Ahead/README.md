## New things learned in this project

## Intro

In this challenge we will create a type feature that will present us a list of cities and states in the US ,and their population, coming from a JSON file that contains all of that data. We can search for a keyword in the search input field and it will pop up a window that that will display to us all the relevant options based on our query,and highlight the matching words.

## User Stories

If I'll type something like 'new', I should see a list of all the cities and states in the US that contains the word 'new', like 'New York, New York', 'New Orleans, Louisiana' etc. The section of the city or state name that contains 'new' should be highlighted and also I should see the population number, where a series of 3 numbers are seperated by commas.
