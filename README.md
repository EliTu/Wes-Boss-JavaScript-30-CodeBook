# Wes-Boss-JavaScript-30-CodeBook 
### *By Eliad Touksher*

This repository is the code and my personal studying notebook for the Wes Boss's 'JavaScript 30' tutorial course, which contains 30 JavaScript (But also some CSS based) challenges and mini-projects, each one focuses on different concepts of the JavaScript language and engages from various perspectives.

Each mini-project has its own folder in which lies the code files and the notes that I wrote while completing the challenge with the instructions of Wes Boss. 

In some of the challenges I'll try to solve by myself and compare the results with the Wes' solution and in I'll forllow along Wes for the sake of studying. 

## Challenge Status list:
- [x] Challenge #1 - JavaScript Drum Kit
